## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 11
  
  For me, lab 11 was my favorite lab because we delt with an object class and its member functions. At first, it was challenging because we had to refer to the original class “State” in part-1, but once I referred to lecture notes it wasn’t so hard and the rest was easy using a for loop for the rows and columns. Essentially part-2 was similar but we had to create the guessing game so navigating through it wasn’t hard because it was simple “if” statements. Overall, lab 11 gave me a run for my money which led to me pushing my critical thinking skills deeper.

* Lab 6
  
  My second favorite lab is lab 6. Lab 6 was memorable for me because it was the blackjack game and the process of doing it. Part-1 wasn’t too hard because it was just validating the string command lines for the user. However, part-2 was a lot more challenging because it involved a lot of logical expressions for the different card functions. An example was a lot of true and false statements if statements. Moreover, it was a great lab because for me it was the first big game we did in the labs.

* Lab 2
  
  My final and third favorite lab is lab 2. Lab 2 looking is really simple and all but it was an important one. The lab involved the simple functions of the “Cin” and “Cout” creating a user input program using basic string variables. Still, this concept allowed me to have a basic understanding of how basic user input works in C++. Overall, this lab wasn’t hard but it gave me a good understanding of how C++ syntax works especially knowing C++ isn’t an easy coding language for beginners.
